You're about to initialize a Firebase project in this directory:

  /Users/daniel/Desktop/daniels-humane-society

Before we get started, keep in mind:

  * You are initializing in an existing Firebase project directory

[info]
=== Project Setup
[info]
[info] First, let's associate this project directory with a Firebase project.
[info] You can create multiple project aliases by running firebase use --add,
[info] but for now we'll just set up a default project.
[info]
[info] i  .firebaserc already has a default project, skipping
[info]
=== Database Setup
[info]
[info] Firebase Realtime Database Rules allow you to define how your data should be
[info] structured and when your data can be read from and written to.
[info]
[info] Skipping overwrite of Database Rules.
[info] The rules defined in database.rules.json will be published when you do firebase deploy.
[info]
=== Hosting Setup
[info]
[info] Your public directory is the folder (relative to your project directory) that
[info] will contain Hosting assets to be uploaded with firebase deploy. If you
[info] have a build process for your assets, use your build's output directory.
