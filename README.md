#### By _**Daniel Bennett**_

## Description

_This webpage is a clone of Oregon's humane Society webpage which has links to pages that show animals that can be adopted, information on pet care, donation links, and services. I'm recreating this webpage using angular. Original website: https://www.oregonhumane.org/_



## Setup/Installation Requirements

* Clone or Download from Github @ https://github.com/MrDanielBennett/Daniels-Humane-Society.git
* In root of directory run "$ npm install"
* Next run "$ npm run build"
* Run "$ng serve"
* open up a window on http://localhost:4200/
* To navigate the page click on the buttons on the home page or the navigation bar on the header, to return to the home page click on the title (Daniel's Humane Society)

## Future development
_As of 01/25/19 this cloned website is pretty much just the html css side of the webpage along with the routes connected. The next step in flushing out this website is to start adding the features that are running on the other pages such as the adopting a pet, signing up for the emails, including a database of pets that can be added and edited if a pet is adopted. There are also a few more css items that need to be added to the main page which mostly consists of the footer and filling out some content boxes and showing the current amount of "adopted pets" there are. The final step is to deploy this webpage to Firebase which is needed for running and editing a pet database for this site._
